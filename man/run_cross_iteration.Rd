\title{Run cross-iteration analysis}
\usage{
run_cross_iteration(
  data_iterations,
  results_folder = "results",
  group_by_col = "Tissue",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_iterations}{List of iteration objects created by the
preprocessing pipeline.}

\item{results_folder}{Directory where output files should be written.}

\item{group_by_col}{Metadata column used to group cells when comparing
Betti curves across iterations.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to
`cross_iteration_comparison_with_betti()`.}
}
\value{
The result object returned by
  `cross_iteration_comparison_with_betti()`.
}
\description{
A lightweight wrapper around `cross_iteration_comparison_with_betti()`
that performs the comparison using default settings and writes the
results to `results_folder`. The function is typically invoked from
`run_modular_analysis()`.

\examples{
\dontrun{
run_cross_iteration(data_iterations)
}
