\title{Normalize a curve to sum to one}
\usage{
normalize_curve(curve, grid_points)
}
\arguments{
\item{curve}{Numeric vector of curve values.}

\item{grid_points}{Integer number of grid points; used when the curve sums to zero.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector representing the normalized curve.
}
\description{
Scales a curve so that its values sum to one, guarding against division by zero.
}
\examples{
normalize_curve(c(1, 2, 3), 3)
