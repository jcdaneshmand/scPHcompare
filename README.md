# scPHcompare

This repository contains a set of R scripts for performing persistent homology
analysis and downstream comparison of single cell datasets.  The code base was
originally organised as several stand‚Äêalone scripts.  A small wrapper
`unified_pipeline.R` is now provided to run the whole workflow from a single
entry point.

## Running the pipeline

1. Prepare a metadata CSV describing each sample.  The
   `process_datasets_PH` function in `run_ph_pipeline.R` expects columns
   `File Path` and `Sample Name` at minimum.
2. Call `run_unified_pipeline()` with the metadata file and an output
   directory.  Additional arguments are forwarded to `process_datasets_PH`.

```r
source("unified_pipeline.R")
results <- run_unified_pipeline(
  metadata_path = "metadata.csv",
  results_dir = "results",
  num_cores = 8,
  integration_method = "seurat",
  run_cross_iteration = TRUE  # optional
)
```

The wrapper runs the preprocessing and persistent homology analysis first.  If
`run_modular_analysis()` or `run_cross_iteration()` are available they are
invoked when the corresponding flags (`run_modular` or `run_cross_iteration`)
are set to `TRUE`.  See the individual scripts for the detailed options of each
step.
